This is a submission for ReadyPlayer3's gaming hackathon.


To get started, clone the repo and open the directory in your CLI.

With the directory open, type 

`npx thirdweb upload .`

#### (note the period "." to specify your current directory!)

 This will upload the files to IPFS and will give you a link to where you can find the hosted game. 

### This repo also includes the .unitypackage which has all of the code used for this project.
